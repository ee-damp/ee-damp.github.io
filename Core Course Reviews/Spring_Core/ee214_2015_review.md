### EE 214 – DIGITAL LAB  

**Academic Year:** 2014-15

**Semester:** Spring

**Professor(s):** Prof.S.Lodha , Prof.S.Ganguly , Prof.M.B.Patil

**Motivation:** To enhance the understanding of concepts taught in the EE 224 course 

**Course content and topics covered:**  
This lab is broken into two parts – hardware and software . While hardware consisted of 5 breadboard experiments , software included 5 Verilog experiments with a Verilog based project in the last 3 weeks .  

**Evaluation:**  

Lab experiments – 30% ( Pre lab counts for 10 %)

Midsem 1 – 20% ( Breadboard)

Midsem 2 – 10% (Verilog)

Endsem – 40% (Verilog)

Lab Experiments : The lab experiments were easy but it is important to learn how to debug circuits properly during them . Most circuits never work on the first try and debugging is especially useful during the exams where time matters . This is true for Verilog based experiments as well . It is also important to inculcate good design practices which makes debugging easier .

Midsems :

Midsem 1 was based on the 5 breadboard experiments and was just an extension of the circuits built during those lab experiments .

Midsem 2 was held just a few weeks after introducing Verilog and was extremely easy . The purpose was just to ensure people had been writing their own codes during the preceding experiments .

Endsem : The endsem was all Verilog and was once again based on the experiments and project done previously . As long as one wrote their own codes during the lab experiments , it was quite easy .

**Grading:** Please refer to the relevant ASC page.

**Difficulty:** Easy , but time consuming due to the pre-labs.
