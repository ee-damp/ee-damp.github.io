### EE 334 – POWER SYSTEMS



**Course offered in:**



Spring 2018



**Instructors:**



Prof. Anupama Kowli



**Course Content:**

Basic three phase system concepts, Transmission line modelling and parameters, power flow, Y-bus and Z-bus formulation, balanced and unbalanced systems, fault analysis and protection, stability, frequency control

**Prerequisites:**

There are no prerequisites as such. A brush up of the topics covered in EE 111 and EE 222 may be useful for some parts of the course.


**Feedback on Lectures:**

The current course content is pretty extensive for a power systems course and teaching picks up pace as the semester proceeds. It might not be easy to always follow the professor in the class but the professor is approachable and helpful. She makes an effort to make the curriculum relatable and relevant by relating the concepts learnt with the 2012 Indian blackout and by showing simulations.It is advisable to pay attention to the simulations not just to enhance conceptual understanding but also because related questions were asked in endsem. The lectures slides cover all points but not in a detailed manner hence it is advised to pay attention. Solved examples in slides are useful for exams.

There were 3 quizzes (best 2 taken, total 20%), a midsem(30%) and an endsem(50%). Quizzes were on the easy side while midsem and endsem were moderately difficult. It is a calculation heavy course and hence, midsem and endsem were lengthy.

6 tutorials and their solutions were uploaded. It is important to solve them diligently as it takes time to develop a knack to solve these type of questions. While solving questions, emphasis should be on understanding the data given. The tutorial questions form a reasonably comprehensive practice problem set.


**Difficulty:**

Concept wise, the course is moderately difficult. However, it is mathematically intensive and adequate practice is required to be able to solve questions.

**Study Material and References:**

1. Power System Analysis by John Grainger and William Stevenson
2. Power System – Analysis and Design by Duncan Glover, Mulukutla Sarma and Thomas Overbye

The lecture slides and tutorials are enough for the course. However, for additional explanation, one may refer to the book.
