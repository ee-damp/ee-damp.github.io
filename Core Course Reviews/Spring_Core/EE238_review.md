**Your Name and Batch**
Aayush Rajesh, 2024(B.Tech)


**Course Offered In**
Spring 2022


**Instructors**
Prof. Kishore Chatterjee and Prof. Anshuman Shukla


**Prerequisites**
EE114 - Power Engineering-I


**Difficulty**
On a scale of 1-5, with 1 being least difficult and 5 being most difficult: 3/5


**Course Content**
FIRST HALF:
Review of Induction Machine: working principle, basics of speed and torque control of induction machines. Basics of DC machines and their speed and torque control. 
SECOND HALF:
Introduction to power electronics. Covered convertors such as buck, boost, buck-boost, single phase and three phase inverters. Studied the steady-state analysis of dc-dc converter in continuous and discontinuous conduction mode.


**Feedback on Lectures**
In the first half, Prof. Chatterjee proceeded at a good pace, covering each concept thoroughly and with utmost clarity. Each lecture is well structured and flows into the next smoothly. Most of what is taught in-class makes use of the blackboard/annotations, with the slides only covering important points, therefore it is crucial to stay attentive throughout the lecture.


The second half of the course was taken by Prof. Shukla, where the pace picked up a bit compared to the first half. However, the lectures were still thorough and easy-to-follow, and the professor ensured that the concepts taught were clear to everyone. The slides used by the professor are also very detailed, and help revision easier after having attended the lectures.


**Feedback on Evaluations**
We had 2 assignments, 2 scheduled quizzes, 1 short quiz, a mid-semester exam and an end-semester exam.
