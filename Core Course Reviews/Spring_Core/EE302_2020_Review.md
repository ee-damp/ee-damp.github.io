3) Stability Theory (Routh-Hurwitz, Root Locus, Bode Plots, Nyquist Criterion)

**Feedback on Lectures:**

The lectures were well paced. The instructor used the board to explain the concepts so taking notes is important. The lectures are based on the reference text. The reference text does an excellent job in covering and understanding most topics.
