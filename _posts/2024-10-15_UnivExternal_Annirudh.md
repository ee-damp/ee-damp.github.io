### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Analog/Digital Design

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
The selection process was based on the submitted resume via PT Cell, where they looked into the projects I had mentioned and if I had sufficient experience to take up projects they have available in their research group. One thing which my supervisor mentioned was that they were impressed with my hands-on experiences - in my case it was my technical team (MRT), so that gave me an edge over other applicants. 

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
The major challenge was the funding, visa and application process after the selection. Although I had been "officially" selected for the intern, without the funding and visa it would be meaningless. This involved painstakingly collecting and filing various documents including Bonafide Certificates, Transcripts, English Language Certification, LoRs and many more. My funding was through the DAAD-IAESTE program which again involved a lot of technicalities, nitty-gritties regarding the applications and unexpected delays. Without the DAAD application being final and getting a German Work Permit after that, the visa process won't proceed ahead as well. Thankfully, the institute authorities were helpful and always ready to help. The uncertainty involved in this process is huge, but it was worth it at the end.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
Apart from this, the other university programs which I had applied for were MITACS and USC Viterbi. Through MITACS, I had interviews with the professors for my first two preferences and it really went well. At the end of my interviews, the professors were very impressed and gave me assurance that I would be their first preference. But sadly, I never saw the light at the end of the tunnel. I mailed the professors enquiring them regarding the same after the first round of results, and they replied back saying that they got alloted their third-fourth preference candidates and have no idea why it happened. My USC applications also got rejected due to profile mismatch as expected. University Interns and for that matter of fact, all internship applications require a huge amount of luck. Keep at it, so that you don't miss out when it comes knocking at your door.

### During the internship:
#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
The project during my internship involved circuit design and electronics testing for the readout from a Cryostat - for a dark matter detection experiment foreseen at Gran Sasso Laboratory, Italy. My output goal was the design of a daughter card PCB which will be integrated with a FPGA card to generate test signals, feed into the Cryostat and then analyse the returned signals to get results. This project was based more on the implementation perspective rather than research perspective, which gave me a lot more clarity and end-goal to focus at. It involved characterisation of various components - amplifiers, filters to meet target specifications, optimising for maximum performance and putting together everything using a multi-layered PCB.

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
The overall experience as a univ intern was nothing less than eye-opening. Though at the start of the year univ intern was not my first preference, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as I actually got to learn much more about the field I am interested than what I could have out of a company intern. I got to work with crazy expensive equipment like VNAs, Spectrum Analysers (with capabilities upto 40GHz), Cryostats, particle accelerators, etc. which you will find rarely even in our own institute. And finally, seeing my output being used for big-scale dark matter research was satisfying, seeing that I was able to contribute to something big. 

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The organisational culture in most European institutes is different than the Indian institutes' scenario. In my case, KIT has different campuses dedicated to Research and Teaching each. I worked at the research campus, where all the PhDs used to work, and professors used to visit rarely. The research groups and the direction of work is dominated and shaped by PhDs - so if you get a good supervisor as was my case, you are in for a treat. The PhDs and my other work mates were very welcoming and understanding. They let me go at my pace, clear my doubts at ease and gave me space to ideate. We used to have lunch together as a research group, where we used to share anecdotes (most were about local and national football games). To keep my budget in check, I used to cook my lunch daily and take it to the campus, and they loved to have a taste to enjoy the Indian spices!

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
I got explore the campus, and learned about many more research groups which work there. In future, I wish to move more towards the integrated chip design space rather than the macro-circuit space. So I connected with those research groups, got to know about what they are working on currently and what they are interested in a research candidate who wants to join their group.

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
This internship is a must if you want to explore and learn more about circuit design and implementations. You get to learn to design for real-life specifications and work with some important testing equipment. Considering it's a fully sponsored experience including travel, it's worth every bit. Apart from this, one major highlight was the fact that Germany is at the center of Europe, so you can travel to many of your dream destinations during the weekends - Rome, Venice, Paris, Copenhagen and many more! Backpack travelling on a budget is an experience on it's own.
