### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Machine learning 

#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
Professor asked me basic question about linear Algebra and he asked me to review his one paper and just we discussed about that , basically confidence is the key and basic first year maths that you have covered in MA105 and Ma110 would suffice the role I was targeting for :)

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
Umm I would say start mailing as soon as you can because after December they stop taking offline interns for me atleast , as such no other challenges I faced during the selection process.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
See professors hesitate to take second year interns so be ready for the rejection also out of your 100 email only 2 or 3 will  get answered so keep your expectations realistic and potentially apply to that univ/ Prof only but it's never nasty to go beyond your reach :/

### During the internship:
#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
My topic was mixed integer convex optimisation 

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
It was moderate to good my intern was quite a hectic so less time for third year intern also you have to cook on your own and lots of adjustment so overall these things made my experience little shaddy but yeah it was a nice experience overall .

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The culture is very prone to work life balance heavy on life side they are chill like they don't make you work on weekends .

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
Yeah it was 

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
Yes

#### Any other insights which you want to provide people aspiring to pursue university internships or research in general?
