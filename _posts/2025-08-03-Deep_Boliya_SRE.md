### Basic Information

- **Project Title / Domain**: Anti-drone Systems
- **Name**: Deep Boliya
- **Guide**: Prof. Debraj Chakraborty 

### Description of Abstract / Project

A swarm of drones need to collaborate to take down an enemy drone either the kamikaze way or encircling it and finally using a close range attack/capture like a net.

### Whom did you work with?

The prof directly, Peers (Other UG students)

### Relevant Courses

EE638 - Estimation and Identification, EE622 - Optimal Control Systems, EE659 - A first course in optimization, AE700 - Guidance of unmanned autonomous vehicles

### How did you connect with the prof?

Had been in contact with the professor since the first course he took - EE302 - Control Systems. Approached by mail first and then had a meeting regarding the topic
p.s. might use present tense at some places because I am still continuing the project under him:)

### Expectations from Prof

The project is ongoing. Professor expects me work on simulations and theory and finally deploy it on hardware as well. I look forward to meet the prof to give updates where he can provide me some feedback on the work and the next steps that can be taken

### Logistics of the Project

The project is on a large scale where multiple people(UGs and PGs) are collaborating hence it's a long project. The professor kept alloting me parts of the project (similar pace of work) where I can contribute directly throughout the semester but gave us a break during midsem and endsem.

### Reading Material

Had to read up papers involving multi agent pursuit-evasion games.

### Tools / Simulations / Softwares / Hardwares Used

Airsim built-on Unreal Engine 5. Python. Deploying on hardware is a future goal as of now.

### Outcomes / Deliverables

Simulation Results and Documentation of all the work that had been done.

### Extension to DDP

Yes, I am continuing under the same Professor for DDP. The prof organises meet where we can discuss about the progress and he knows the amount work that can be done in a given amount of time so that we do not burn out.

### Type of Project

implementation-driven

### Connection to DDP

SRE helped me gain traction on the project by learning about the simulators and some theory related to pursuit-evasion games

### Advice
