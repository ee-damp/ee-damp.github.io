### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Astronomy


#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
DAAD-WISE is a program specific to German research institutes, so I started off by mailing a lot of professors at these places. I used to attach my CV and transcript (latter can be skipped if your CPI is not something you'd want to highlight). 

Max Planck Institutes are one of the top research places in any discipline, and luckily one of the scientists at MPIfR took notice of my email. 

We had a short call initially, wherein I was asked about my background in infrared astronomical data analysis (a key skill the project needed) - but no technical questions per se (I think if you're thorough with the concepts that shows on its own in the way you speak, the terms you use etc). After that they wanted to know about the DAAD-WISE logistics, to make sure my funds and insurance would be covered for by them. Post that it was mainly an exchange of emails - DAAD needs a HUGE amount of documents (list on their website) - and our next real-time meet was directly after my arrival in Germany!

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
I think the single biggest hurdle for programs (like DAAD) is getting a professor's attention, getting them to reply and accept you for an open position or project, that is also doable in a duration of a few months, that they must be having already (count the number of events that need to occur simultaneously there!).

Unfortunately mails are the only way to reach them, unless you have professors who know you well here at IITB and have collaborators there. Tailoring the mails is essential to make sure it is not discarded as one among hundreds. Highlighting key skills, nontrivial acheivements and showing how you're a good fit for what work they do definitely helps.

Getting university internships offline, outside of programs, to me is practically impossible - you need a professor who has a doable project/position for an undergrad and also has the funding to bring you there - take notice of your mail and accept you. That is essentially why top US universities go out of league for offline internships. Online projects are always possible of course, since that gets rid of the logistical issues like visa and doesn't need the professor to pay you. But that would need a project actually doable online - fields relying on physical labwork get wiped out there.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
Not getting any replies to your emails to professors asking for internships is very common, you in fact won't get replies 90-95% of the time. I fortunately already knew this, and did not keep my expectations of getting replies very high. The key is to remember that one single positive reply is all you need, and hence keep trying. Also keep in touch with your friends who are apping, and talk to seniors (who'd be probably doing their own round of apping for grad school!) to realize you're not alone!

The second set of annoyances accompanied the DAAD application. The paperwork required is enormous - but it is more of a time-consuming chore than an intractable problem!

### During the internship:
#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
I studied the central black hole of the Milky Way in infrared wavelengths using images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). For context the telescope is worth $10 billion, the largest one (6.5 m mirror) in space, and is probably the most revolutionary instrument in astronomy currently!

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
The experience was amazing. I learnt a lot, my project was successful (as in we found what we were looking for in the data), learnt cooking and living completely on my own and had a blast touring across 9 countries in Europe!

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
For all practical purposes I was treated as a (temporary?) PhD student. Max Planck Institutes only house researchers at PhD and above level, so no UGs. A couple of master's students do their theses there. 

My guides were super-helpful and made sure I could go along at the right pace. I sat in the same room with other PhD students, and had a good time with them - all were friendly and helpful and eager to show me around the city! Two of them also invited me to parties, and we had a good time together!

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
A lot! The project I was working on was part of a larger project that included scientists/professors from Harvard, McGill and UCLA. I met regularly with the Harvard collaborators and I'm hoping I'd be able to use these connections somewhat to my favour in my PhD applications later this year :)

Apart from my personal project, the institute regularly hosted talks by other scientists - you could go and listen to them and freely interact!

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
Definitely! Germany has some great research institutes and you'll be sure to find one that you'd want to work in. And Europe is pretty to tour around - I don't think I need to elaborate on that :)

The problem, however, is that DAAD closed down this year - so the funding source has disappeared. However, some professors have their own funding through grants etc - they might be able to bring you on their own money but the problem becomes in finding them out, and then of course in them taking notice of you.

#### Any other insights which you want to provide people aspiring to pursue university internships or research in general?
Getting replies to mails is hard, but don't give up. With DAAD and MITACS both closing down, I'm less aware of what programs you could actually apply to. Finally, if your area of interest allows it, an online internship is easier to get and can be as or more fruitful than an offline one (the one first-author research article I published in June this year was finished from start to end without having a single real-time meet with my professor!)
