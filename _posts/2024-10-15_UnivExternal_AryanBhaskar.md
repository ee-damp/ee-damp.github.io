### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Semiconductor Devices


#### Can you elaborate on your interview and the type of questions which were asked?
I just expressed my interest and attached my resum√©. A few professors, including the one I eventually ended up working with mailed me back and set up Zoom meets. The interview was mostly based on the professors telling me about their labs and research interest and discussing logistics, and not wholly focussed on asking any aptitude questions as such.

#### Were there any significant roadblocks or challenges that you encountered during the internship application and selection process? If so, how did you navigate or overcome them?
There were mainly logistical issues with securing a J-1 visa in the US. These were navigated by being in constant contact with the international student services at my university and monitoring visa appointment times on the US Govt. websites.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
While cold mailing, the approach that I had in mind was that I might send hundreds of emails and not get a single approach.

While I was fortunate enough that I got a response in the first few emails I sent out, I feel it could be a point of stress and dejection. One must convince themselves that the cold mailing process has a lot of variables, and not getting a response doesn't reflect your merit in any sense.

### During the internship:
#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
RF Semiconductor Devices

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
My overall experience was good. It focussed on several aspects of electronic device analysis, including exploratory studies on novel structures and mainly focussing on RF drain delay analysis of RF HEMTs. Some contact resistivity measurements using 4-probe technique and TLM were also done. 

The first set of analysis done involved data extraction, and plotting transconductance, ON resistance, threshold voltages and drain current on OriginPro software.

The second set of was RF HEMT device drain-delay analysis, which involved a significant literature review and then working on Keysight's ADS (Advanced Design System).

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
The lab I was working at mostly consisted of PhDs and postdocs. There wasn't a standard internship programme atleast in the lab/research group I was working with. As a result, I was the sole intern and the only undergraduate in the lab.

However there seemed to be a few other departments who had a dedicated programme, but that needs to be explored.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
I spoke to a few PhD students at my lab, and connected with them professionally.

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
To be perfectly honest, there isn't any sense of recommending the internship, because it was achieved via a personal contact with the professor. It is not a standard internship role. Having said that, similar roles can be explored at the University at Buffalo via cold mailing. My own experience however was fairly decent.
