### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: Structural Health Monitoring with Dual-Mode Ultrasonic Guided Waves : Front End Design
- **Name**: Kudupudi Puja Naga Prasanna
- **Project**: Structural Health Monitoring with Dual-Mode Ultrasonic Guided Waves : Front End Design
- **Guide**: Prof. Siddharth Tallur

### Description of project

The project focuses on structural health monitoring (SHM) of pipelines using ultrasonic guided waves. This is an ongoing PhD project for developing an FPGA-based SHM platform using piezoelectric transducers for defect detection and monitoring. I collaborated with the PhD senior in developing the front-end for the next version on PYNQ board such as electronics hardware (PCB design), power circuits and Graphical User Interface for dual mode guided wave system.

### Worked With:

softwares: Kicad, Qt Designer. Reading Materials: research papers of the PhD work, PCB Design guidelines for reduced EMI, component datasheets, competitors UI designs, Power Amplifier circuits

### Relevant Courses

Electronic Design Lab (EE344)

### How did you connect with prof?

I have worked with the professor during my internship, which was based on software, and I have developed interest in PCB design and hardware part during my EDL. Around the first week of July, I approached the professor to discuss potential BTP topics, expressing my interest in working on a project involving DACs, ADCs, multiplexers, FPGAs, and circuit design—areas I became particularly enthusiastic about during EDL. Based on these interests, sir has suggested me the project on Structural Health Monitoring using ultrasonic guided waves. I found the hardware-focused front-end design aspect very engaging, so I was happy to finalize it as my BTP topic.

### Expectations from Prof:

The professor expected regular progress and consistent output throughout the project. From my side, I was looking for a technically challenging project where I could learn more about electronics system and work on hands-on components. 

### Outcomes of BTP:

BTP-I: fully functioning PCB for dual mode guided wave SHM system.
BTP-II: power board, graphical user interface for the FPGA system

### Experience

Yes. I enjoyed working on the topic during BTP-I and I also attended a conference on Non-Destructive Techniques in December, where I got tons of motivation and exposure to ongoing research and real-world applications in this domain. I wanted to build on the foundation laid in BTP-I and contribute further towards improving the system in BTP-II.

### Advice:

If you're considering a project under Prof. Siddharth Tallur, my advice would be to come prepared with a clear idea of what you enjoy working on and your core technical interests. It helps a lot if your interests align with the professor’s ongoing work, but even if not, you can propose a topic that excites you—he is open to suggestions if the idea fits well with his interest. It’s important to be active in discussing logistics, expected timelines and work. Regular and consistent work is key. 
Students who worked with Prof. Siddharth Tallur did wide variety of project like electronics hardware, FPGA, ML, eddy current and some have continued their EDL projects while some came up with their own project topic.
I encourage students to explore labs, speak to seniors, and choose a project that aligns well with both their interests and the lab’s direction.
