### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: Formation Control on Crazyflie Drones
- **Name**: Unnikrishnan M Narayana Pillai
- **Project**: Formation Control on Crazyflie Drones
- **Guide**: Prof. Dwaipayan Mukherjee

### Description of project

Implementation of Bearing-Only Formation Control on Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 Drones via ROS2 Standard Libraries

### Worked With:

Robot Operating System (ROS2 jazzy on Ubuntu)

### Relevant Courses

nan

### How did you connect with prof?

Visited prof in the office to discuss interests and goals, showed previous relevant internship/project experience. Prof assigned project based on the discussion.

### Expectations from Prof:

Expectations from me : Learn how to operate ROS and implement the formation control via simulations and hardware.

Expectations from prof : right guidance via PhD mentor about references and relevant resources.

### Outcomes of BTP:

Simulation run through as well as hardware attempts.

### Experience

Yes, due to interest in completing the project. I planned ahead for the last semester too.

### Advice:

Prof. Madhu Belur, Prof. Debraj Chakraborty have similar control systems based projects available. Prof. Dwaipayaan expected honest effort and progress based on it, lenient on results if enough impact and progress is made, considering the project is done by a BTech student.
