### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: EEG data aquisation and streaming on FPGA
- **Name**: Sumit londhe 
- **Project**: EEG data aquisation and streaming on FPGA
- **Guide**: Siddharth Tallur

### Description of project

This was a part of a bigger project on which a PhD was working on. The project was to develop a high density FPGA based EEG aquisation system with real time signal processing on hardware with low latency for various EEG applications like motor imagery, prosthetic arm, etc 

### Worked With:

Mostly on vivado software, xilinx FPGA and also some time on Kicad in btp2 for designing a PCB

### Relevant Courses

nan

### How did you connect with prof?

After EDL I directly asked the prof for btp next sem

### Expectations from Prof:

Prof expextation: Dedication and integrity, he expected a time commitment, and as long as you give your best, he was fine even if things doesn't work.

My expectations: Not too much time commitment, regular guidance and flexible meets

### Outcomes of BTP:

A complete flow for EEG data aquisation including a PCB with ADCs for collecting analog data and sending it to our xilinx board in digital format for further processing. 

### Experience

Yes, i liked the project, time commitment was decent, and prof was chill if you give him decent hard work and commitment 

### Advice:

If you are interested in application of digital and vlsi knowledge in real life, I would definitely recommend him. But he can be very strict at some time, and you need to give proper time commitment (like I was giving almost 6-7 hrs a week on average). But if you show enough dedication, the grading is chill.
