### Basic Information

- **Project Title / Domain**: Musical Analysis of Indian Drums
- **Name**: Aditya Sanjog Kabare
- **Guide**: Sibi Raj B Pillai

### Description of Abstract / Project

Our main concern was understanding the 2D vibrating modes of Indian Drums such as Tabla and Mridangam which exhibited harmonic characteristics. We eventually want to create a complete analysis of the internal air column as well. For the SRE, we start with the 1D variant and try to gain intuition of the system.

### Whom did you work with?

The prof directly

### Relevant Courses

nan

### How did you connect with the prof?

I contacted him via email if he was available and what topics he was offering. Then we met in-person in his office and confirmed the topic and project expectations.

### Expectations from Prof

The only thing the prof expects is consistent and decent effort from my side throughout the semester. My expectations were really just that the project should be interesting and no unreasonable work.

### Logistics of the Project

There was no exact timeline. We met once a week and updated on the progress we made. Timeline post-midsem was about keeping the final presentation date range in mind.

### Reading Material

We had one small book as a starter into the historical progress on the analysis of Indian drums. We looked at the one paper each on modelling 1D and 2D non-uniform string/surface and analysing the harmonic modes.

### Tools / Simulations / Softwares / Hardwares Used

No specific tools. Programming simulation was done using python with standard libraries.

### Outcomes / Deliverables

1) Model the 1D non-uniform string characteristics from its density profile
2) Create a programming model which takes the string profile and gives the modes
3) Draw conclusions from different simple density profile examples

### Extension to DDP

Yes. The topic was interesting to me and something different than what we normally see.

### Type of Project

theoretical

### Connection to DDP

SRE was on a simplified version of the main problem. The DDP extends it naturally into the main problem.

### Advice

The prof leaves the reigns of the project to you and hence you should have the proper self-motivation to continue the work without any sort of constant pressure from the top.
