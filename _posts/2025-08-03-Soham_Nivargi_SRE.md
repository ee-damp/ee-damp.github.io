### Basic Information

- **Project Title / Domain**: Window-Based US Beamforming/Image Processing
- **Name**: Soham Nivargi
- **Guide**: Satish Mulleti

### Description of Abstract / Project

Design beamforming algorithms for ultrasound imaging to account for region wise constrast enhancement using window functions. Manage window artifacts and improve overall image quality using data from multiple angles. Devise angle selection strategy for sub sampling.

### Whom did you work with?

PG students, The prof directly

### Relevant Courses

CS663, EE338, EE229

### How did you connect with the prof?

Mailed him, met him directly

### Expectations from Prof

Weekly meeting are expected and substantial work is expected many times. Prof expects that the student covers up if he misses a meeting.

### Logistics of the Project

Weekly, before midsem the milestones were easier to easy to deal with. After midsem nearing the ppt, you need to show some kind of results.

### Reading Material

Papers on IEEE given for reference from where the idea originated

### Tools / Simulations / Softwares / Hardwares Used

Matlab

### Outcomes / Deliverables

Interim results on different types of window functions

### Extension to DDP

Yes, improvement was possible

### Type of Project

implementation-driven

### Connection to DDP

Provided a base, continued w same project

### Advice

If you like image processing, the projects are good. It can be demanding at some times and chill at other times :)
