### Getting into the Internship:

Machine learning

The process was stupid, just click on sign in button and you will be selected if yoh are unlucky

None

I was selected in one go

### During the internship:
#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
Machine learning

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
Very very very very poor. This was a real opportunity killer

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
I did not went for internship, was no funding. Ptcell will force you to go on your own pocket and would not allow to apply anymore. 

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
No, It hampered me to sit in Pt-cell insternship for months

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
Do not apply for internships through Pt-cell. They apply shitty rules in university internships. If they mention your funding will be through some programme beware. If that programme has very low chance if success then you can't sit anymore.
