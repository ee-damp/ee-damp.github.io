### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: Thermal comfort Analysis & Monitoring
- **Name**: Sarvadnya Desai
- **Project**: Thermal comfort Analysis & Monitoring
- **Guide**: Anupama Kowli

### Description of project

Built and briefly tested ESP32 based sensor nodes which record the temperature and relative humidity around the sensor node. Connected the sensor nodes using a server, where users could submit their thermal comfort vote for further analytics.

### Worked With:

Arduino IDE, soldering equipement, KiCAD PCB design tool

### Relevant Courses

EE344: Electronics Design Lab and some basic prototyping skills I picked on during my time in UMIC, SeDriCa 

### How did you connect with prof?

The prof. published the requirement for a student interested in Embedded System Design via the batch representative.

### Expectations from Prof:

Regular weekly sync meetings and steady progress to report. Thorough reasoning of the applied methods and strategies proposed was to be provided.

### Outcomes of BTP:

A sensor network documentation and the actual prototypes we made.

### Experience

Yes, I did extend it to a BTP-2. I was interested in working on a hands on project and I had a good rapport with the professor.

### Advice:

Plan your logistical requirements properly. Theoretical projects can be completed with streamlined efforts in the final week, but hardware projects need consistent planning & management efforts. You cannot wake up in the last week.
