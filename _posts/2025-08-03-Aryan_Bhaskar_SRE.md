### Basic Information

- **Project Title / Domain**: Review of Widebandgap Semiconductors and their Applications in the EV framework 
- **Name**: Aryan Bhaskar
- **Guide**: Apurba Laha 

### Description of Abstract / Project

The title is self-descriptive

### Whom did you work with?

The prof directly

### Relevant Courses

EE207, EE728, EE457

### How did you connect with the prof?

Mailed and met him. He had a list of two broad areas I could work in, but it wasn't initially something I was wholly on-board with. I proceeded to show him some research work I had undertaken for on a personal basis, and he liked that work and proposed a new amalgamated project that was very well-suited to my interests.

### Expectations from Prof

I expected that the professor would allow me freedom to work on ideas independently and be able to give me contact hours whenever I wished to discuss something. He had an expectation of something that would, even if not as an evaluative component of SRE, eventually go down a publishable pipeline.

### Logistics of the Project

Logistics were flexible. Meetings happened as often as I wished to update my guide.

### Reading Material

I had to source them on my own, though my guide initially provided relevant current literature to set the motivation.

### Tools / Simulations / Softwares / Hardwares Used

It focused more on researching extensively and writing about my findings.

### Outcomes / Deliverables

An IEEE format paper and a pedagogical set of slides to introduce and summarise the work.

### Extension to DDP

Yes, I have expanded into DDP, while continuing a portion of my SRE work and inculcating a broader and diverse areas of research.

### Type of Project

theoretical
