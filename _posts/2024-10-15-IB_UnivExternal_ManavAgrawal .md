The biggest challenge is to get a positive reply from a professor and for that I was writing mails unique to skills and background of each prof to make them believe that we have actually gone through his work and are genuinely interested.

#### How did you handle any rejections that you faced (If any) during the internship application process?
Cold Mailing and apping can be very tiring and frustrating as there can be many hurdles, but just keep your calm and be patient. I remember, I started mailing in December but finally got internship in March so yeah it's a lengthy and tiring process but just keep trying as all it takes is one positive response.

Reducing the runtime of transformer models using low-level optimizations

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
I had a PhD supervisor who was an Indian too so yeah communication was really easier. Also professor was really friendly, she used to do lunch with all of us sometimes and we also had weekly meets to ensure that project is going in right direction. I had other peers from France, US etc from whom I leaned a lot.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
Yeah we get together with the peers from different countries and also we were working in collaboration for a company to whom we needed to deliver that product. So yeah connections of that company too.

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
Yeah sure, it was a great experience. Everything is great about summer research internship as we go to new countries, we see their culture and learn from them. My project itself was very interesting. Only thing to worry maybe that we need to cook ourselves:) and manage some housework. Also 2nd yr students need to prepare for their upcoming 3rd yr internships which can be hectic to do along with all other factors
