### Basic Information

- **Project Title / Domain**: PMMs in minimal Kitaev chain
- **Name**: Debasish Panda 
- **Guide**: Prof Bhaskaran Muralidharan 

### Description of Abstract / Project

We study the physics behind a double quantum dot connected via a superconducting lead which can host a Majorana bound state (MBS) on each dot. This is known as the N-S-N setup in quantum transport parlance. Such MBS are called as "poor man's Majoranas" or PMMs since they are not topologically protected, but otherwise share the properties of MBS formed in other topological systems. PMMs are of vital interest to us since they can be used in quantum computing architectures.

### Whom did you work with?

The prof directly

### Relevant Courses

EE755, EE787, PH436

### How did you connect with the prof?

I took up EE491 (optional RnD elective) under Prof Muralidharan and read the basic fundamentals needed to work on this project during that interval. You can drop a mail to the prof and he'll provide you a list of topics which you might be interested in, following which your project will be finalized.

### Expectations from Prof

The final aim of the project remains to publish a paper (theory + simulation results), and you can continue the work even after the formal completion of the SRE if you want a publication. The prof mostly expects you to read up the basic theory by yourself, and you'll have to put in quite a bit of effort for the simulations since there's no skeleton code for them as such. 

### Logistics of the Project

Prof Bhaskaran is actually quite chill with the logistics. Ideally, you should meet up with him once a week to discuss your progress, and there's no milestones as such you need to complete during the SRE. He expects you to maintain a short report/slides documenting the simulations/theory, and that's about it.

### Reading Material

My work was mostly limited to skimming through research papers, most of the theory involved can usually be ready from short reports found on Arxiv. The books in involved in this particular topic are heavily inclined towards the physics side, so it can be a tad difficult to read from them as such. There's a standard reference book by Prof Supriyo Dutta that's written from an engineering POV, and that's about the most you'll need.

### Tools / Simulations / Softwares / Hardwares Used

Python, occasionally using the kwants package 

### Outcomes / Deliverables

I wasn't able to complete the final goal of the project before the end of the semester, so naturally I chose to extend it to my DDP work. Broadly speaking, the outcome of the work mostly involved simulating the conductance signature of specific setups.

### Extension to DDP

Yes, since I want this to evolve into a publication, and as of now, the work done isn't enough to publish a paper.

### Type of Project

theoretical

### Connection to DDP

As I have explained beforehand, my DDP is basically an extension of the work done in my SRE, although I might branch off to a different problem in my DDP stage-2 once this has been completed.

### Advice

Since the prof doesn't impose any sort of timeline/milestones, you'll have to take the responsibility of setting up a timeline for the sake of your sanity. Prof Muralidharan is really chill with grading of research-driven subjects, and you'll easily get an AA if you've got some decent results to show at the end. There's also Prof Debanjan Bhowmik, Prof Udayan Ganguly, Prof Kasturi Saha and Prof Ashwin Tulapurkar who work on similar topics (albeit in slightly different fields of interest)
