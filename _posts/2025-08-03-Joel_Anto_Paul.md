### Basic Information

- **Project Title**: GPS Spoofing and Anti spoofing methods
- **Name**: Joel Anto Paul
- **Project**: GPS Spoofing and Anti spoofing methods
- **Guide**: Sibiraj Pillai

### Description of project

Study about GPS signals, understand how each signal from a satellite is encoded, replicste it incorporating doppler shifts and then estimate gain of each satellite. Then try to subtract this signal so as to remove the particular satellite fr the GNSS data. Followed by finding ways to detect this type of spoofing method

### Worked With:

GNSS-sdr, gpssdrsim, Python, reference materials related to GPS signals

### Relevant Courses

nan

### How did you connect with prof?

In person meet, i was already working under him in the third year

### Expectations from Prof:

I wanted someone who would guide me properly and make me understand how research is done. Prof did not expect us to publish a paper but decent efforts to understand and tackle the problem

### Outcomes of BTP:

We were able to implement a spoofing method, but it was brute force, by adding an extra overpowered signal, but couldnt remove a signal completely. For the same, we proposed anti spoofing methods as well

### Experience

Yes, we wanted to finish what we had started

### Advice:

My advice would be to understand your field of interest, approach the relevant professors, talk about your interests , what you want to do and decide which guide to choose. Most of the professors, react according to your input, so if you put enough efforts you will get something out. This is a general advice and not related to my guide.
