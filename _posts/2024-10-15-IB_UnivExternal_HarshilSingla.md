### Getting into the Internship:

#### What specific domain or field did you target to get an internship in?
Core Electrical

Just needed to submit the resume. There was only one small interview where they asked about the projects written on the resume.

Not really, it was a smooth process through PT Cell

NA

#### What was your specific profile or project topic during the internship?
FPGAs 

#### How would you describe your overall experience as an intern?
It was really amazing!! I worked on a European Space Agency mission that will go to Venus in 2030s. So it was really really cool to work on real space tech and an overall amazing experience!

#### Could you provide insights into the organizational culture of the company/university and what your peers were like?
I had a PhD supervisor who was supposed to work with me (but I had to do all the work in the end). There was another senior research scientist who would come in and monitor progress.

#### Were there any networking opportunities or professional connections that you established during the internship?
I was able to create a good connect with my professor but apart from that there wasn't much interaction with the other people working there.

### After the internship:

#### Based on your experience, would you recommend this internship to others interested in the same field? If so, what aspects make it worth recommending? If not, what factors influenced your perspective
Yes definitely! The biggest plus point is getting exposure to good quality research which can really help you decide if you want to pursue academia. Also being able to explore Europe and take trips on weekends is a huge opportunity. I visited around 10 countries in 2 months without taking any holidays! So if you're a travel buff or interested in academia, this internship is for you!
