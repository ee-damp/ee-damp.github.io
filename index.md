### About
Our lives in IIT are hostel-centric. We tend to interact more with our wing-mates and hostel-mates rather than department people. So if there are few hostel seniors (or maybe even none) from your department, it is possible that one misses out on department related information like interesting courses or projects, timetable issues and the like. The nitty-gritties in courses, some pre-planning/timeline making are some things which only an experience can advise about. The EE-DAMP intends to bridge this gap, to bring about this information exchange in an effective manner. 

That said, the DAMP also helps students struggling in academics. We help in bridging the gap between the student and the department and faculty (especially his/her faculty advisor(s)). Also, we intend to obtain feedback from students regarding the current curriculum, so that our faculty gets to know the students perspective about academics. To help out the Institute Academic Council, the DAMP mentors also request professors for summer/winter projects so that students can get some research exposure.
